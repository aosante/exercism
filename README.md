# Exercism

My solutions to exercises from exercism.io ðŸ“š

Currently working on the JavaScript and Ruby tracks.

Similar to HackerRank or AlgoExpert, [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a site to develop skills in data structures, algorithms, and general problem solving.

Each exercise contains a README showing the problem being solved and how to run the tests locally.
